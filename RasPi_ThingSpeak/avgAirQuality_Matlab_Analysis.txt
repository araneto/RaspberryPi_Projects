% Channel 667186 contains data from a DHT22 sensor on a Raspberry Pi, located 
% in Hasselt, Belgium. The data is collected once every 15 seconds. 

% Channel ID to read data from

% Temperature Field ID
temperatureFieldID = 1;
% Humidity Field ID 
humidityFieldID = 2; 

% Read sensor data
temperature = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID,'Fields',temperatureFieldID,'NumMinutes',60,'ReadKey',readAPIKey); 
humidity = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID,'Fields',humidityFieldID,'NumMinutes',60,'ReadKey',readAPIKey); 

% Calculate the averages 
avgTemperature = mean(temperature);
avgHumidity = mean(humidity); 

% Display the averages in the output window below
